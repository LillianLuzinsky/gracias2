# Gracias - A gratitude app

I took the idea from hardcopy gratitude diaries.<br>
The concept is pretty basic but can have a powerful positive effect.
The simple habit of reflecting on what youâ€™re grateful for can actually lead to a happier, more content life. <br>
All it takes is a few moments of your time and a gratitude journal to record your thoughts.<br>
This app, however, goes one step further.
it also allows the person to think about not only events that made them happier,
but also the people and to be more mindful in showing appreciation to such people.
