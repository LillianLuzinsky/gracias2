# Gracias 
## A gratitude app

I took the idea from hardcopy gratitude diaries.<br>
The concept is pretty basic but can have a powerful positive effect.
The simple habit of reflecting on what youâ€™re grateful for can actually lead to a happier, more content life.
All it takes is a few moments of your time and a gratitude journal to record your thoughts.<br><br>
This app also has the added feature of writing down names of people who've had a positive effect on you,
and how you can show your appreciation towards them.
